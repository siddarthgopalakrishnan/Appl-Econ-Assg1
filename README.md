Applied Econometrics Assignment 1<br/>

(Analysis was done using R).<br/>

1. Run an econometric regression model on your dataset giving proper justification for selection
of the variables. Interpret the coefficients of your variable appropriately.<br/>
2. Prepare Graph Matrix for your dataset. Comment on the association between dependent
variable & independent variables of your dataset.<br/>
3. Plot the predict Y and discuss the accuracy of your model.<br/>
4. For regression model fit in Question 1, run the tests for checking following OLS assumptions
and interpret your results.<br/>
    a. Heteroscedasticity<br/>
    b. Multicollinearity<br/>
    c. Normality of the error term<br/>
    d. Omitted-Variable Bias<br/>
5. Based on results of Question 4, use the remedies to address the issues identified and alter your
model suitably.<br/>
6. For your model, run two joint tests (F-test) giving justification for the same. Interpret the results.<br/>
